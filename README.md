## To compile and test

- You need nodejs and npm

Inside the `.secret` file there is a mnemonic key that should not be used on the mainnet, it is a key for public use where we will perform tests on the testnet network. Here you can enter your own key if you wish.

- Install the dependencies with `npm install`
- Compile with `npm run build`
- Test with `npm run test`
